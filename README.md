This is a project I did while first learning to code. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

In this project, I learned accessibility. Accessibility is making your webpage easy for all people to use â€“ even people with disabilities.
  I built a quiz webpage. I learned accessibility tools such as keyboard shortcuts, ARIA attributes, and design best practices.
